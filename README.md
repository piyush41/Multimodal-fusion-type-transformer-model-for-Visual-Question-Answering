# Multimodal-fusion-type-transformer-model-for-Visual-Question-Answering
Given an image and a natural language question about the image, the task is to provide an accurate answer.  Used transformer-based architecture to extract features from the image(ViT,BEiT) and to obtain the embeddings of the question(BERT,RoBERTa).Apply the fusion layer for cross-modal interaction
